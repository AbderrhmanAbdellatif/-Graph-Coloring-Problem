# Graph-Coloring-Problem
Assign colors to all vertices such that no adjacent vertices have the same color and print the assigned colors.
1) First add an edge and form a graph by adding different vertices. 
2)Assign the first color to the first vertex
3)A temporary array to store the available colors.
4)True value of available[cr] would mean that the
5)Color cr is assigned to one of its adjacent vertices 
6)Assign colors to the remaining V-1 vertices
7)Process all adjacent vertices and flag their colors as unavailable 
8)Find the first available color
9)Assign the found color
10)Reset the values back to false for the next iteration 
11) Print the result
We run the code by first ad
